[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pacman-repo-builder?logo=rust)](https://crates.io/crates/pacman-repo-builder)

Build a custom pacman repository from a collection of PKGBUILD directories.

## Runtime Dependencies

* pacman
* makepkg
* libalpm.so.13
* libgit2.so

## Usage

**âš  WARNING:** This program is meant to be used within a docker container.

### Manifest file

Manifest file is always named `build-pacman-repo.yaml`. It contains instruction to build a pacman repository.

### Generate manifest file

Listing every member in a manifest file can be a chore. So when there are no members with customized properties, you can generate the manifest file the reflect the build directories instead:

```sh
build-pacman-repo print-config \
  --repository $repo_dir/$repo_name.db.tar.gz \
  --container build-directories \
  --require-pkgbuild \
  --require-srcinfo \
  --with-install-missing-dependencies true \
  > build-pacman-repo.yaml
```

_Note:_ Replace `$repo_dir` with path of your repository directory. This directory would contains all built packages.
_Note:_ Replace `$repo_name` with name of your repository file. This file would be fetched by `pacman` to check for updates.

### Replace `/usr/bin/makepkg` with one that allows running as root

The normal `makepkg` script does not allow running as root. While it may make sense in a user's machine, it inconveniences a Docker container.

```sh
build-pacman-repo patch-makepkg --replace
```

### Build a pacman repositories

```sh
build-pacman-repo build
```

_Note:_ Make sure that `build-pacman-repo.yaml` file exists in current working directory.

### Print help message

```sh
build-pacman-repo help
```

```sh
build-pacman-repo --help
```

```sh
build-pacman-repo help $command
```

```sh
build-pacman-repo $command --help
```

## GitHub Action

[pacman-repo-builder/action](https://github.com/pacman-repo-builder/action) let you run `build-pacman-repo` on an Arch Linux container.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does this program do?

Its main purpose is to build a pacman repository. When the `build` command is called, it will read all source infos from either `.SRCINFO` or `PKGBUILD`, sort them by their dependency relationship, then build them one by one.

### Why does this need to be ran inside a container?

In order for this program to function properly, it must make several changes to the host system, such as:
* Replace `/usr/bin/makepkg` with one that allows running as root, so that it may be used in a CI environment.
* Install every built package just in case it may be depended upon by another package.

### A simple shell script should be enough

If your use case is simple, good for you, just use shell script. If you are confident that you can provide all the features with shell script alone, also good for you, but I have already provided them with this program, so you don't have to.

### Why YAML?

It is nice.
